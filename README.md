# Random Password Generator

## Description

In the event that a new user account on any application is created, randomly generated passwords are often required for user authentication. There are a number of criteria that can be included in a password to increase its security, namely by varying the case of the password, and including numeric or special characters. In this appication, the user is prompted by the window to select the desired criteria for a randomly generated password. The inputs are computed into a JavaScript function which checks for invalid entries in password length or empty entries in character type.
